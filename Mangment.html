	<p class="t3">A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components). ... Donors can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation)
	Blood donation is an integral part of the health and well being of the community. The need is constant, and there is no substitute for volunteer blood donations. Every 2 seconds, someone needs a blood transfusion. And, each donation can help save up to three lives.Apheresis (Automated) Donation. The apheresis process allows us to remove only a portion of your blood (platelets, plasma, red cells, or white blood cells). A needle will be placed in your arm. Blood will flow through the tubing attached to the needle into a system that will collect the desired component.Sometimes people who donate blood notice a few minor side effects like nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting, but these symptoms usually go away quickly. The donor's body usually replaces the liquid part of blood (plasma) within 72 hours after giving blood.In the past, a person who received a tattoo had to wait 12 months before being eligible to donate blood. ... Currently, a tattoo is acceptable if the tattoo was applied by a state-regulated entity using sterile needles and ink that is not reused.Notice a raised bump, continued bleeding or pain at the needle-stick site when you remove the bandage. Feel pain or tingling down your arm, into your fingers. Become ill with signs and symptoms of a cold or flu, such as fever, headache or sore throat, within four days after your blood donation.Donating blood isn't a pain-free experience. ... You shouldn't feel any pain while the blood is being drawn, but you may experience an uncomfortable sensation at the site where the needle is inserted into your arm. You may also feel pain at the needle insertion site after your donation, especially if your arm is bruised.How long will it take to replenish the pint of blood I donate? The plasma from your donation is replaced within about 24 hours. Red cells need about four to six weeks for complete replacement. That's why at least eight weeks are required between whole blood donations.</p>
